# Exam #2: "Compiti"

## Student: s339129 Bonamico Carola

## How to Download and Run

To download and run this project, follow these exact steps in a clean directory:

```sh
git clone ...yourCloneURL...
cd ...yourProjectDir...
git pull origin main  # just in case the default branch is not main
git checkout -b evaluation final # check out the version tagged with 'final' and create a new branch 'evaluation'
(cd server ; npm install; nodemon index.mjs)
(cd client ; npm install; npm run dev)
```

- Make sure all required packages are installed via `npm install` in both `server` and `client` folders.
- If you have installed some packages globally, they may not appear as required dependencies. Always check with a clean install.

## React Client Application Routes

- `/login` — Authentication page (**public**)
- `/` — Dashboard homepage with assignments overview and role-based navigation (teacher/student) (**protected**)
- `/assignments` — Assignment list filtered by user role (**protected**)
- `/assignments/:id` — Assignment detail, answer submission (student) or evaluation (teacher) (**protected**)
- `/assignments/new` — Create new assignment (teachers only) (**protected, teachers only**)
- `/statistics` — Student statistics and analytics (teachers only) (**protected, teachers only**)

All routes except `/login` are protected and require authentication. The `/assignments/new` and `/statistics` routes are further restricted to users with the teacher role. Routing is managed with React Router and role-based route protection.

## API Server

Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api`

### Quick API Overview

- **POST `/sessions`** — Login, create user session
- **GET `/sessions/current`** — Get authenticated user (401 if not authenticated)
- **DELETE `/sessions/current`** — Logout, destroy session
- **GET `/students`** — List all students (authentication required)
- **GET `/assignments`** — Assignment list filtered by user role
- **GET `/assignments/:id`** — Assignment detail
- **POST `/assignments`** — Create new assignment (teachers only)
- **PUT `/assignments/:id/answer`** — Submit answer (only group students)
- **PUT `/assignments/:id/evaluate`** — Evaluate assignment (only assignment creator teacher)
- **GET `/statistics`** — Student statistics (teachers only)

All protected APIs require an active session (HttpOnly cookie managed by backend). 401 errors are handled silently on the frontend.

## Initial Database Data

The initial database is automatically populated with a complete set of test data to support all application features and test scenarios:

- **Teachers**: 2 accounts with realistic names and emails, both using the password `password123`.
- **Students**: 22 accounts, each with a unique name and email, all using the password `student123`.
- **Assignments**: At least one closed and one open assignment are pre-created, with realistic questions, group compositions, and evaluation data. These assignments are distributed among the teachers and student groups to allow immediate testing of all flows (creation, answer, evaluation, statistics, group constraints).
- **Passwords**: All user passwords are securely hashed using Node.js crypto.scrypt with a unique random salt for each user, following best security practices.
- **Group constraints**: The initial assignments are set up to demonstrate group size limits, collaboration limits, and exclusive group membership rules.

The following table lists all initial user accounts (teachers and students) with their credentials and roles for easy access during testing:

| Username                             | Password    | Role    | Name                |

## API Test Files (`server/test.http`)

The file `server/test.http` implements a suite of HTTP tests covering all main API features, business rules, and error cases. Tests are organized by scenario and role, ensuring robust coverage of authentication, authorization, and edge cases.

**How to run:**

- Start the server (`npm start` in the server folder)
- Open `server/test.http` in VS Code with the REST Client extension
- Click "Send Request" above each test to execute

| Category               | Example Test Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication         | Login as teacher/student, check session, logout         |
| Unauthenticated Access | Access students/assignments endpoints without login     |
| Teacher Functionality  | Create assignment, evaluate, get statistics             |
| Student Functionality  | Submit answer, forbidden assignment creation/evaluation |
| Authorization          | Student tries to answer assignment not assigned to them |
| Edge Cases             | Invalid login, non-existent assignment, invalid input   |
| Group Constraints      | Exceed group size, duplicate collaborations             |
| Answer Validation      | Empty/whitespace answer, valid/invalid answer formats   |

## Database Management Scripts

The server includes npm scripts for database management:

| Script                       | Command                        | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initialize DB**      | `npm run init-db`            | Creates database, tables, and inserts test data     |
| **Reset DB**           | `npm run reset-db`           | Completely resets database (⚠️ deletes all data!) |
| **Generate Passwords** | `npm run generate-passwords` | Generates new random password hashes                |

### Group Constraint Rules

The system enforces these business rules for assignment groups:

1. **Group Size**: 2-6 students per assignment
2. **Collaboration Limit**: Any pair of students can collaborate maximum 2 times per teacher
3. **Exclusive Groups**: Students can only be in one active assignment group at a time per teacher

**Example Constraint Violation**:
If students Alice and Bob have already worked together in 2 assignments from Prof. Smith, they cannot be assigned together in a third assignment by the same professor.
